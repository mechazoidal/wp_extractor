* Some [Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org) classes and scripts to export data
  from a Wordpress ~3.3 installation. I wrote it to pull my posts from my
  personal blog when moving it to [Zenweb](http://www.zenspider.com/projects/zenweb.html)

* It doesn't really do a whole lot else, but it might provide a nice starting
  point for a general-purpose Wordpress DB schema gem.
